The idea behind this book entitled "Explore Python for Mathematics" is a foundation to explain the programmatic approach for Mathematics oriented research problems at the practical level. It explains various kinds of concepts, such as data types, data structures, operators, arrays, matrices, vectors, and function. Advanced topics such as solution of equations, eigen value problems, interpolation and approximation, numerical differentiation, initial value problems for ordinary differential equations, set theory, probability distribution, packages and data visualization are also covered in depth. The scope of this book covers a broad range of people including faculty members, researchers, students, and programmers to gain knowledge about how Python codes are written to construct a model for solving complex problems.
